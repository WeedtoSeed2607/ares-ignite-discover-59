# Mobile App Setup Instructions

## What's Been Implemented

âœ… **Mobile-Responsive Website**: The website now adapts to mobile screens with:
- Collapsible sidebar that becomes a drawer on mobile
- Mobile header with hamburger menu
- Touch-friendly navigation
- Responsive layouts

âœ… **Capacitor Setup**: Dependencies installed and configured for mobile app generation

## Testing the Mobile Website

The website is now mobile-friendly and will work better on phones immediately. Test by:
1. Opening the website on your phone's browser
2. Resizing your browser window to mobile size
3. The sidebar will automatically become a mobile drawer

## Generating Mobile App (APK/IPA)

To create the actual mobile app files:

### Prerequisites
- Git account connected to export your project
- Android Studio (for Android APK)
- Xcode on Mac (for iOS IPA)

### Steps

1. **Export to GitHub**
   - Click "Export to GitHub" button in Lovable
   - Git pull the project to your local machine

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Add Mobile Platforms**
   ```bash
   # For Android APK
   npx cap add android
   
   # For iOS IPA (Mac only)
   npx cap add ios
   ```

4. **Update Native Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npx cap update android  # or ios
   ```

5. **Build the Web App**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Sync to Mobile Platform**
   ```bash
   npx cap sync
   ```

7. **Run on Device/Emulator**
   ```bash
   # Android
   npx cap run android
   
   # iOS (Mac only)
   npx cap run ios
   ```

## Hot Reload Development

The Capacitor config includes hot-reload pointing to your Lovable sandbox, so you can:
- Make changes in Lovable
- See them instantly in your mobile app during development
- No need to rebuild constantly

## Next Steps

1. Test the mobile website immediately
2. When ready for app store distribution, follow the setup instructions above
3. For production, update the `server.url` in `capacitor.config.ts` to your published domain

Your app now works as both a responsive website AND can be converted to native mobile apps! ðŸš€
